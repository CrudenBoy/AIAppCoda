# üìò Vibe Coding Assistant ‚Äì Knowledge Base

## Overview

This document equips your chatbot (e.g., Gemini Apto, ‚ÄúRoo‚Äù) with a structured workflow for tackling sync and performance issues in GitHub-integrated sessions. It also aligns tightly with your **Vibe Coding** philosophy for AI-assisted development.

---

## 1. Fresh Session Initialization

**Step**: Start a fresh AI thread/session
**Why it matters**: Clears stale context and resets the AI‚Äôs ‚Äúfocus‚Äù to relevant, current tasks. This is critical in vibe coding, which emphasizes *iterative, context-aware prompting* ([docs.replit.com][1]).

---

## 2. Provide Repo Snapshot

**Step**: Attach a repository snapshot (zip, branch link) with README to explain structure
**Why it matters**: Keeps the context limited and clear‚Äîaligns with vibe coding‚Äôs emphasis on *providing minimal yet sufficient context to the AI* .

---

## 3. Include UI Image or Video Context

**Step**: Upload a image or a 30‚Äì60‚ÄØsec screencast demonstrating the issue, with narration
**Why it matters**: Improves multi-modal understanding‚Äîcore to vibe coding, where visual context empowers intelligent prompt steering .

---

## 4. Craft a Precise Prompt

Use this **Objective/Scope/Constraints/Desired Output** template:

```markdown
**Objective**  
Investigate why `useEffect` in `src/components/App.jsx` causes an infinite fetch loop.

**Scope**  
Files: `App.jsx`, related fetch logic.

**Constraints**  
- Follow lint rules  
- Maintain desktop & mobile compatibility  
- No new dependencies

**Desired Output**  
1. Root-cause explanation  
2. Code patch (diff)  
3. Unit test or logging steps
```

**Why it matters**:

* Voice starts with verbs‚Äîaction-focused
* Defined scope minimizes confusion
* Constraints ensure legacy and style compliance
* Clear desired output guides AI termination and success criteria
  This aligns with vibe coding norms of *structured prompting for reliable iteration* ([docs.replit.com][1], [businessinsider.com][2], [zapier.com][3], [blog.thepete.net][4], [docs.replit.com][5]).

## 5. Break Tasks into Modules

Follow this staged workflow:

1. **Confirm context & replicate bug**
2. **Debug root cause**
3. **Implement patch**
4. **Add tests/documentation**
5. **Review & refactor code**

**Why**:
Modular division reduces complexity and supports the *Chain-of-Vibes* technique‚Äîiterative, AI-led steps with human review pauses ([zapier.com][3], [blog.thepete.net][4]).

---

## 6. Enforce Human Oversight

* Review all AI-generated suggestions
* Refactor code manually; don‚Äôt copy-paste blindly
* Test edge cases rigorously
  These practices address common vibe-coding concerns around quality and safety ([businessinsider.com][6], [reddit.com][7], [en.wikipedia.org][8]).

---

## 7. Integrate with Git & CI

* Use dedicated branches for each AI session
* Commit atomically with messages like `fix(ui): prevent infinite spinner`
* Delete branches after merging
  Maintains cleanliness, rollback safety, and CI alignment‚Äîbest practices in both AI-driven and traditional software workflows.

---

## ‚úÖ Sample Workflow

1. **Session started**: Upload repo snapshot + UI video
2. **Prompt Phase 1**: Confirm context & replication
3. **Phase 2**: Debug root cause
4. **Phase 3**: Apply patch + tests + docs
5. **Phase 4**: AI-provided refactor
6. **Human review**: QA ‚Üí Merge ‚Üí Delete branch
7. Repeat for new issues

## üß† Vibe Coding Cross-References

* **Multi-modal prompting & iterative refinement**: core vibe practice ([officeofadamthede.com][9])
* **Minimal context with sufficient details:** matches efficient AI prompting ([docs.replit.com][1])
* **Chain-of-Vibes / modular prompting**: ensures clarity and safety ([blog.thepete.net][4])
* **Human oversight & testing**: necessary to counter AI‚Äôs blind spots ([docs.replit.com][5])

## üìå Integration Suggestions for Your Knowledge Base

* Use bold headings and markup styles to help the chatbot query specific sections
* Include example prompts and responses per module
* Provide template snippets for each stage
* Cross-link with ‚ÄúVibe Coding‚Äù doc sections (see above)
* Update over time to reflect evolving tools and workflows
