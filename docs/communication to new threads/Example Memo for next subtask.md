### 0. Project & Repository Context

This thread continues our work on the AI Presenter App. For full context, I have uploaded the complete project repository.

**We are working exclusively on the following branch:** `feature/db-refactor`

### 1. Context & Recent Achievements

We have just successfully completed **Phase [Previous Phase #]**: [Name of Completed Task].

* **Summary of Achievements:** [Briefly describe the outcome of the last completed task. e.g., "We successfully resolved the critical TTS regression by correctly re-integrating the TTSManager using the useRef singleton pattern."]
* **Code Status:** [State the current status of the code. e.g., "The code for this fix has been committed and pushed. The application is stable."]

### 2. The Next Strategic Step

Our immediate priority is to execute **Phase [Current Phase #]: [Name of a Pending Task from the PRD]**.

The primary objective is to [State the high-level goal of the new task, e.g., "implement the backend endpoints and frontend UI for submitting tasks and responses from the web app back to Coda."]

### 3. Your Initial Task for This Thread

Your first action is to generate a detailed **S.C.A.F.F. prompt** for the Roo Code Agent to execute **Sub-task [Sub-task #]**: [Title of the very first sub-task].

### 4. Standing Orders & Methodology

* **Editor:** VS Code with the Roo Code extension.
* **AI Roles:** You are the Project Manager (Vibe Codex); Roo is the Code Agent. I am the human-in-the-loop for testing and external actions.
* **Source of Truth:** The **"Vibe Codex: Project Knowledge Base"**, the **"PRD"** and uploaded github repo are the definitive sources of project information, which you must reference.
* **Philosophy:** We strictly adhere to the Vibe Coding methodology.

### 5. Critical Instructions for This Thread

* **Targeted Action:** Your first output must be the specific S.C.A.F.F. prompt for the first sub-task. Do not create a high-level plan, as that work is already complete in the PRD.
* **Role Definition:** In each response, clearly outline the specific actions for "David" (me) and "Roo Code".
